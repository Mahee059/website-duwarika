      <p className='max-w-[600px] text-center text-xs '>Born out of Mr. Dwarika Das Shrestha`s quest to preserve the Kathmandu Valley`s heritage, Dwarika`s Hotel is a sanctuary for the architectural grandeur of the Newari civilization. The intricately carved wooden treasures, with each artifact being an original, are the soul of the Dwarika`s. Titled as an oasis in the middle of a bustling city, the peaceful courtyards display the grand architectural wooden masterpieces while being overlooked by the meticulously decorated spacious rooms, offering a unique experience deep-rooted in Nepalese culture. The Dwarika`s is many things- a labor of love, a realization of architectural heritage conservation, a place where you are treated like royalty, and never just a luxury boutique hotel. </p>
